# Mobile Detailer Bloggin App
The Detailer Blog app allows users to post their most recent detail jobs that they are proud of and want to show off. Users are able to sign up, and then login. Once a user is logged in they will be presented with a blank dashboard from which they will be able to enter a new detail. Once the user has some posts they can open an individual post by clicking on the title and opening the full information for the car detail, and if necessary they are able to update the post or delete it.
